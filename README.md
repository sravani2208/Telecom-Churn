Problem Statement
BUSINESS PROBLEM OVERVIEW
Customer churn prediction is extremely important for any business as it recognizes the clients who are likely to stop using their services
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.
For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, you will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, do exploratory data analysis to identify the main indicators why customers are leaving the company.
BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:

REDUCING CHURN RATE

GENERAL GUIDELINES:
Well-structured, formatted, and commented code is required.

Exception Handling, Production Grade Code & Deployment Ready Code will be a plus. Those students will be awarded some additional credits.

The additional credits will have advantages over other students during Star Student selection.

    [ Note: - Deployment Ready Code is defined as, the whole .ipynb notebook should be executable in one go
              without a single error logged. ]
Each and every logic should have proper comments.

You may add as many number of charts you want. Make Sure for each and every chart the following format should be answered.

# Chart visualization code
Why did you pick the specific chart?
What is/are the insight(s) found from the chart?
Will the gained insights help creating a positive business impact? Are there any insights that lead to negative growth? Justify with specific reason.
You have to create at least 20 logical & meaningful charts having important insights.
[ Hints : - Do the Vizualization in a structured way while following "UBM" Rule.

U - Univariate Analysis,

B - Bivariate Analysis (Numerical - Categorical, Numerical - Numerical, Categorical - Categorical)

M - Multivariate Analysis ]
